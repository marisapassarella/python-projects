# python-projects

A repository containing my python projects. 

## 1. Bike Station Map 
This project was done for my Computer Programming course in which the objective was to develop an application that can load data from either a local or remote source and display it 
graphically and interactively. I am very interested in making maps, so I used the python library folium to create an interactive map of the Indego Bike stations in the city of Phildelphia, PA.
I used the coordinates of the stations to make the map and then was able to join two datasets to then add the station names to the pinpoints. I then saved the map as an html file as seen above.

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe 
This project is a basic tic-tac-toe game that can be launched through any IDE in which the game will appear on the desktop. This project was done for my Computer Programming course
in which the objective was to create a point-and-click GUI game.
